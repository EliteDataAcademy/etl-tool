# PySpark ETL Pipeline

## Overview

This repository contains an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline implemented using PySpark. The pipeline is designed to handle large-scale data processing tasks, including extraction from various sources, transformation using PySparkâ€™s powerful API, and loading data into target systems such as databases or cloud storage. This solution is optimized for performance and scalability.

## Features

- **Extraction**: Read data from various sources, including CSV, JSON, Parquet, and databases.
- **Transformation**: Perform complex data transformations using PySpark DataFrame operations.
- **Loading**: Write transformed data to different target systems, including databases, cloud storage, or file systems.
- **Configuration**: Easily configurable through YAML files to specify data sources, transformation rules, and targets.

## Prerequisites

- **Python**: 3.7 or later
- **Apache Spark**: 3.0 or later
- **Java**: 8 or later
- **Hadoop**: 2.7 or later (if using HDFS)
- **Python Libraries**: `pyspark`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `py4j`
